Coagulated aerosols are aggregates of solid particles, distinguished by their wispy appearance, these structures are unique as the size of these aggregates far exceeds the range of forces that hold them together. Shown to have density correlations of a power-law form, through the use of these power-law correlations, a simulation model can then be generated which demonstrates a discrete version of dendritic growth. This model can then be compared to other low-density object producing models, such as the Eden growth model. 

## Diffusion limited aggregation

## The Eden Model
This is the simplest model for the formation of aggregates. It describes how particles are added randomly one at a time to sites adjacent to the occupied sites.

## The approach of Forrest and Witten
The group of aggregates studied by Forest and Witter were shown to have density correlations of a power-law form. The aggreates were formed when a metal vapour of a heated plated filament was quench condensed.The metal particles condensed near the filament and diffused outwards. The particles coalesced into thin spherical shells which then drifted onto the microscopic slide. The aggregates on the slide were of the order of 10^{5} metal particles in a low-density mass. 

The coalescence of the particles into the aggregate structures was noted to be irreversible. Since they were observed to maintain their wispy shapes even after they wouls have moved through the gas.
